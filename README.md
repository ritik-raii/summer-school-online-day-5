Chrome Extension that shows real-time weather using user's geolocation and WeatherAPI.
- Weather Chrome Extension â€“ Summer School Day 5

This is a simple Chrome Extension I built as part of the Web Development Internship organized by Summer School IIT Jammu (Day 5). It shows live weather based on your current location using WeatherAPI.

-  What It Does
 Detects your location using the Geolocation API
 Gets weather data from WeatherAPI.com
 Shows:
 City name
 Current temperature in Â°C or Â°F
 Weather condition (like "Sunny", "Cloudy") with icon
Lets you switch between Â°C and Â°F
Saves the last weather result using localStorage
Shows a loading message while fetching
Handles cases where location is denied or API fails
